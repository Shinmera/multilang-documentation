Some documentation strings can be referred to by different
specifiers. For instance:

- ('foo 'function)

All refer to the same documentation string. This function
should return a value that identifies a docstring for the
given object and type. The same (under EQUAL) value must
be returned for any object and type combinations that
should refer to the same docstring.

You should add appropriate methods to this function for
custom documentation specifiers / types.

If a LANGUAGE instance is passed, the language instance is

IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST can be one of the following values,
designating the behaviour if no language for the given
identifier can be found:

    :CREATE  --- A new SIMPLE-LANGUAGE instance is created
                 and associated with the identifier.
    :ERROR   --- An error of type NO-SUCH-LANGUAGE is
                 signalled. The following restarts will be
                 available:
       USE-VALUE     --- Return the given restart value.
       STORE-VALUE   --- Associate the given restart value
                         with the identifier and return it.

                         :if-does-not-exist :create
    NIL      --- Returns NIL.

When USE-VALUE or STORE-VALUE are called interactively, the
value is read and evaluated, and then passed through LANGUAGE
to potentially coerce it to an existing language object.

If LANGUAGE is not an instance of LANGUAGE, the value is
coerced to a LANGUAGE instance by way of the LANGUAGE
function.

When reading a docstring from an inexistent language, NIL
is returned as well as a NO-SUCH-LANGUAGE instance as the
secondary value.

When writing a docstring to an inexistent language, a new
language instance is automatically created by way of the
:IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST :CREATE argument to the LANGUAGE function.

If you are implementing your own subclass of LANGUAGE that
bypasses the DOCUMENTATION-STORAGE mechanism, you should
add methods to this function that provide the desired
behaviour.

  (function documentation
    "Retrieve the documentation string for the given object and type.

You may optionally specify the language that the docstring
should be in. The default language is *LANGUAGE*, which
will typically be automatically configured according to your
system's locale settings.

When reading a docstring, if there is no documentation stored
specifically for the given language, and the language is eq
to *LANGUAGE*, CL:DOCUMENTATION is consulted instead.

When writing a docstring, if the language is eq to *LANGUAGE*,
the docstring is also written to CL:DOCUMENTATION. Note that
your implementation might not store docstrings for unknown
documentation specifiers, but the language object will always
do so regardless. Either way, this mechanism is mostly provided
as a best-effort backwards compatibility to users of
CL:DOCUMENTATION.
